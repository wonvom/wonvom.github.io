# Two Sum

### **Problem**


Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to *`target`*.
<br>

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
<br>

You can return the answer in any order.
<br>
<br>


**Example 1**
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 3**
```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```
<br>
<br>

### **Solution** <br>
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        numMap = dict()
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            complement = target - nums[i]
            if complement in numMap:
                return [numMap[complement], i]
            numMap[nums[i]] = i

```


### **Explain**

1. Initialize an empty dictionary `numMap` to store the elements of the *nums list* as *keys*, and their *indices* as *values*.
2. Iterate over the elements of the `nums` list using a for loop.
3. For each element num, compute the `complement` of num, which is the value that needs to be added to `num` to get the `target` value.
4. Check if the `complement` exists in the `numMap` dictionary. If it does, return a list containing the *indices* of the two elements that add up to the *target* value.
5. If the `complement` does not exist in the `numMap` dictionary, add the *current element* to the dictionary as a *key*, with its *index* as the *value*.
6. After the loop completes, return an empty list.

```
Example 1 : nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
i = 0  -> 9 - 2 = 7 -> 7 is not in numMap, so numMap[2]=0
i = 1  -> 9 - 7 = 2 -> 2 is in numMap, so return [numMap[2],1] -> [0, 1]
```

### **Complexity**

Time Complexity : $$ \mathcal{O}(n) $$<br>
Space Comlexity : $$ \mathcal{O}(n) $$<br>

- In the code, the time complexity of the twoSum function is  $$ \mathcal{O}(n) $$  because the function performs a single loop over the elements of the nums list, and the time taken to execute the loop is directly proportional to the number of elements in the list.
